He started therapy with <a href=\"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/\"><strong>The Zeebah Place (TZP)<\/strong><\/a> in February 2014 when he was 9 years old. Before that time we had tried other places and although they had tried their best for our son, we have not been to any place that the <a href=\"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/consultants\/\">therapists are so diligent<\/a>, attentive to detail and patient like TZP.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although at the time and age Uthman joined TZP he already knew his letters and numbers, we were impressed at how he improved generally within a short period of time. We are grateful for the therapists\u2019 ability to support and develop his curiosity in Mathematics. We are very satisfied with the level of complexity of Mathematics, English and other social skills taught.
