There are various warning signs and symptoms, but they usually revolve around impaired social skills, speech and language difficulties, non-verbal communication difficulties, and inflexible behaviour.<\/p>\n<h4>Signs of social difficulties<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Appears disinterested or unaware of other people or what\u2019s going on around them<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t know how to connect with others, play, or make friends<\/li>\n<li>Prefers not to be touched, held, or cuddled<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t play &#8220;pretend&#8221; games, engage in group games, imitate others, or use toys in creative ways<\/li>\n<li>Has trouble understanding feelings or talking about them<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t seem to hear when others talk to him or her<\/li>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t share interests or achievements with others (drawings, toys)<\/li>\n<li>Basic social interaction can be difficult for children with an<a href=\"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/zeebah-foundation-autismart\/\"> autism spectrum disorder<\/a>. Many kids on the autism spectrum seem to prefer to live in their own world, aloof and detached from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Signs of speech and language difficulties<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Speaks in an abnormal tone of voice, or with an odd rhythm or pitch (e.g. ends every sentence as if asking a question)<\/li>\n<li>Repeats the same words or phrases over and over, often without communicative intent<\/li>\n<li>Responds to a question by repeating it, rather than answering it<\/li>\n<li>Uses language incorrectly (grammatical errors, wrong words) or refers to him or herself in the third person<\/li>\n<li>Has difficulty communicating needs or desires<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t understand simple directions, statements, or questions<\/li>\n<li>Takes what is said too literally (misses undertones of humour, irony, and sarcasm)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty with speech and language. Often, they start talking lat<\/p>\n<h4>Signs of nonverbal communication difficulties<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoids eye contact<\/li>\n<li>Uses facial expressions that don&#8217;t match what he or she is saying<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t pick up on other people\u2019s facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures<\/li>\n<li>Makes very few gestures (such as pointing). May come across as cold or \u201crobot-like.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Reacts unusually to sights, smells, textures, and sounds. Maybe especially sensitive to loud noises. Can also be unresponsive to people entering\/leaving, as well as efforts by others to attract the child\u2019s attention.<\/li>\n<li>Abnormal posture, clumsiness, or eccentric ways of moving (e.g., walking exclusively on tiptoe)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Children with autism spectrum disorder have trouble picking up on subtle nonverbal cues and using body language. This makes the &#8220;give-and-take&#8221; of social interaction very difficult.<\/p>\n<h4>Signs of inflexibility<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Follows a rigid routine (e.g., insists on taking a specific route to school)<\/li>\n<li>Has difficulty adapting to any changes in schedule or environment (e.g., throws a tantrum if the furniture is rearranged or bedtime is at a different time than usual)<\/li>\n<li>Unusual attachments to toys or strange objects such as keys, light switches, or rubber bands. Obsessively lines things up or arranges them in a certain order.<\/li>\n<li>Preoccupation with a narrow topic of interest, often involving numbers or symbols (e.g., memorizing and reciting facts about maps, train schedules, or sports statistics)<\/li>\n<li>Spends long periods watching moving objects such as a ceiling fan, or focusing on one specific part of an object such as the wheels of a toy car<\/li>\n<li>Repeats the same actions or movements over and over again, such as flapping hands, rocking, or twirling (known as self-stimulatory behaviour, or \u201cstimming\u201d). Some researchers and clinicians believe that these behaviours may soothe children with autism more than stimulate them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No parent wants to acknowledge that their child has a problem, however with autism, the sooner it [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1148,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[32,34],"tags":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/smilingboy.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/915"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=915"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/915\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2498,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/915\/revisions\/2498"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1148"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=915"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=915"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zeebahfoundation.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=915"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
