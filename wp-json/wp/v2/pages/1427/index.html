A place where your child learns, has fun and practices independent living and social skills.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Part of our goal at The Zeebah Place, is to ensure that every child who passes through our center is able to learn, play and live a more independent life. This includes eventually getting settled to a mainstream school. We know firsthand that parents will give everything they have to see their children fully educated and live out their full potential. This is especially true of parents of children with Autism as well as other special needs.[\/vc_column_text][vc_cta h2=&#8221;First: We find out what special strengths and gifts your child has as well as areas where he \/she needs help:&#8221; h2_google_fonts=&#8221;font_family:Shadows%20Into%20Light%20Two%3Aregular|font_style:400%20regular%3A400%3Anormal&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h2=&#8221;true&#8221; use_custom_fonts_h4=&#8221;true&#8221;][\/vc_cta][vc_column_text]An assessment is conducted with a focus on the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication<\/li>\n<li>Social skills<\/li>\n<li>Challenging Behaviours<\/li>\n<li>Academics<\/li>\n<li>Independence, functional living skills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Next, a unique, individualized program is created for your child which starts where he\/she is, working towards where he\/she should be.<\/strong> Our goal is to ensure that your child masters these skills and then is able to generalize them outside the center\u2019s environment.
